Designed to improve memory and concentration by challenging players to remember the positions of the cards.

## Summary: 

The game consists of a grid of cards with values ranging from 1 to 10, with each value appearing twice.
Cards are shuffled at the start of the game to ensure a random arrangement. At the beginning, all cards are briefly displayed to the player for 5 seconds to memorize their positions.
After 5 seconds, the cards are flipped over to hide their values. Players click on cards to reveal their values. If two cards are clicked, the game checks if they match.
If the cards match, they remain revealed and are marked as matched. If the cards do not match, they are flipped back over after a short delay. The game includes a countdown timer set to 60 seconds.
The timer updates every second and is displayed to the player. The player wins if all card pairs are matched before the timer runs out.
The player loses if the timer runs out before all pairs are matched.

I used to love playing memory games as a child, which brings a sense of nostalgia. I also built the game to help myself remember small things (because to be quite frank, with age, my memory is just not as sharp!)

## Game:

## Future Improvements:
1. Seperate page that loads Instructions and start button
2. Game to shuffle variety of board options- not just limited to numbers (can include letters or words)
3. Integrate the sound into your game (example: timer ticking for 60 seconds or boo noise when player lose)
5. Integrate an effect (example: conffetti takes over screen if player wins)
