    in the html file (DOM) below: the function is establishing when timer starts it will deaulft 5 seconds
    and decrease by 1 sc as time goes on- if tge timer hits 0 then the timer will stop and the message to player is
    you lost the game.
    innerhtml accesses the x element you are reffering to (html data?)
    the const interval is calling the timer to update by seconds:
    JS the seconds are in milliseconds (by the thousands)

        timer.innerHTML = `${startingTime}`
        startingTime-=1 //decrement by one second
        if(startingTime < 0) {
            clearInterval (interval);
            const results = document.getElementById('game-result');  
            results.innerHTML = `${'You Lost!!!'}`
        }
       
    }
    const interval = setInterval(updateTimer, 1000) // has to be in milliseconds
    

    // below function is meant to shuffle the game cards after game is over. the for loop is asking the computer
     to go through each and every card to swap the the current position of card to random position of card


     function shuffle(array){
        for (let i = 0; i<array.length; i++){
           let randomNumber =  Math.floor (Math.random()* array.length)
